# Voote Contract Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

## Environment

```bash
    PRIVATE_KEY=your_metamask_private_key_without_0x
    RPC_URL=https://polygon-mumbai.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY
```

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
    npx hardhat help
    npx hardhat test
    REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
    npx hardhat node
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network amoy
```
